## Summary

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is the default syntax used by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the `render()` method of components.  Currently the DevTools team uses the `React.DOM` interface for `render` methods instead of JSX; this decision was previously made to avoid adding a build step.

### Motivation

JSX makes react components easier to read and was designed so that designers could more easily adapt components in a manner very similar to working with HTML.  With JSX people find it easier to understand the DOM structure compared to the `React.DOM` syntax.  For designers and contributors we hope to see increased understanding and ownership of the components with the change to JSX.

### Existing Projects

The [debugger.html](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html) is currently considering using JSX.  The debugger has a [PR](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/pull/1712) that experiments with the change and an [issue](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/1747) discussing the possibility.

The [perf.html](https://github.com/devtools-html/perf.html) project had previously adopted JSX and plans to continue using it.

## Proposal

Adopt JSX as the default syntax for the `render` method of our react components.

The current DevTools practice for implementing the `render` method of our react components uses the `React.DOM` interface.

Where our current code might look like this:

```js
import React, { DOM as dom } from "react";
class CamelCase extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return dom.div( null,
      dom.img( { src: "avatar.png", className: "profile" }),
      dom.h3( null, [user.firstName, user.lastName].join(" "))
    );
  }  
}
```

A JSX version would look like this:

```js
import React from "react";
class CamelCase extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <img src="avatar.png" className="profile" />
        <h3>{[user.firstName, user.lastName].join(' ')}</h3>
      </div>
    );
  }  
}
```

The JSX version is compiled during the build step to JavaScript code.  You can see a live version of the JSX and compiled code [here](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=es2015%252Creact%252Cstage-0&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=false&code=import%20React%252C%20%7B%20DOM%20as%20dom%252C%20Component%20%7D%20from%20%22react%22%253B%250Aclass%20X%20extends%20Component%20%7B%250A%20render%28%29%20%7B%250A%20return%20%28%250A%20%3Cdiv%3E%250A%20%3Cimg%20src%253D%22avatar.png%22%20className%253D%22profile%22%20%252F%3E%250A%20%3Ch3%3E%7B%5Buser.firstName%252C%20user.lastName%5D.join%28%22%20%22%29%7D%3C%252Fh3%3E%250A%20%3C%252Fdiv%3E%250A%20%29%253B%250A%20%7D%20%250A%7D) to understand how this above example is compiled into code.

> Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar [...](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)

The [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) page goes into detail on the gotchas related to using JSX. There should not be any DevTools specific issues that arise from this change.

### Alternative solutions

The current `React.DOM` interface is the only other major option available and DevTools is already using this syntax.

### Drawbacks

JSX requires a build step, using something like webpack, so if we feel that a build step is not a requirement we are willing to take on then we should not adopt JSX and continue to use the `React.DOM` practices we currently have.  This build step require can continue to be a per-project decision.

### Adoption

As the default option a developer would need only to seek approval from the @devtools-html/devtools-core team when not taking this path.

Here's a simplified control flow:

*   No Build Step?
    *   Use `React.DOM`
*   Using a Build Step?
    *   Use `JSX`

**New Projects**

With all new code we should adopt JSX as the standard practice for our `render` methods assuming the project desires and is able to use the required build step.

**Existing Projects**

As we significantly refactor components of existing projects we should attempt to adopt JSX as the standard practice for our `render` methods. But if a project is unable to use a build step using JSX should not be a requirement.

Furthermore, it is not our goal or intention to refactor all existing source code from the current state to using JSX and a build step.  While there is value in consistency across all the projects it is likely outweighed by the cost of such immediate broad refactors.

### Metrics

Significant metrics will be difficult to gather here. We should see more ownership of the components by less technical contributors and overall a simpler time getting people on boarded.

### Unresolved questions

-   What tools need to be changed?
    -   Linting?
-   How to handle shared components like the Tree component?
