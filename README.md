# DevTools RFCs

Some changes to DevTools need feedback from the team and community to reach a consensus. In such a case you should use this repository to discuss the change proposal.

The DevTools RFC process aims to be lightweight and focused on conversations. Therefore opening a DevTools RFC is as easy as opening an issue in this repository to discuss the proposal.

The [DevTools RFC team][] will be ultimately responsible for accepting or rejecting a change proposal, but the discussion is open to everybody.

The list of RFCs currently under discussion can be found at: [Active RFC List][].

## Creating a RFC

* Create an issue with the "proposal" label
* Get people's attention. Some options:
    * Send an email to [dev-developer-tools][]
    * Post on [Slack][] or on #devtools at irc.mozilla.org
    * mention relevant peers in the issue
* Gather feedback by discussing in the issue

## Reviewing RFCs

Each week the [DevTools core team][] will attempt to review some set of open RFC issues. Reviewed RFCs will also be mentioned in the weekly DevTools team meeting (see archives for [devtools-weekly-meetings][]).

## Accepting/Rejecting a RFC

After a proposal has been discussed and the related issue is ready to be closed, the DevTools core team will be responsible to send a PR to this repo that summarizes the conversation and keeps track of the discussion.

Every accepted feature should have a core team champion, who will represent the feature and its progress. This can be the RFC author, but it's not necessary.

When accepting the RFC the champion should make sure that an actionable item (either on GitHub or Bugzilla depending on the impacted project) has been logged and that work can start.
